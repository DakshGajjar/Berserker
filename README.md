# Berserker

web application created to make short videos containing Reddit posts and comments with a Minecraft gameplay background by just passing the keyword as input. It follows one of the two video generation processes named custom and auto. In the custom process, post will be chosen by entered keyword, while, in auto, a pseudo-random word will be used to choose the post.
